I am Okan Aşık, a PhD Candidate at the [Department of Computer Engineering](www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr) of [Boğaziçi University](www.boun.edu.tr). I am a member of [Robotics Research Group](robot.cmpe.boun.edu.tr). I am the team leader of [RoboAKUT](robot.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/rescue) team (RoboCup Rescue Agent Simulation League Team). I was a member and team leader of [Cerberus](robot.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cerberus) team (RoboCup Standard Platform League Team).

In 2012, I completed M.Sc. Thesis titled as *Using DEC-POMDP Algorithms to Solve Multi-Agent Decision Problems in Robot Soccer* and my supervisor is [Prof. H. Levent Akın](www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~akin).

I have been studying artificial intelligence and robotics for about 8 years. I have worked on many artificial intelligence and robotics projects, most notably Cerberus and RoboAKUT. Currently, I am studying on my PhD thesis titled *Scalable Multi-Agent Decision Making Algorithms for Real World Problems*. My aim is to develop multi-agent planning algorithm which scales to solve complex real world problems having many agents and many states(or continuous state).

My research interests are
* Multi-robot planning in search and rescue tasks
* Multi-agent planning
* High-level robot control
* Machine learning
