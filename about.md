I am Okan Aşık, a PhD Candidate at the [Department of Computer Engineering](www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr) of [Boğaziçi University](www.boun.edu.tr). I am a member of [Robotics Research Group](robot.cmpe.boun.edu.tr). I was the team leader of [RoboAKUT](robot.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/rescue) (RoboCup Rescue Agent Simulation League Team) and [Cerberus](robot.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~cerberus) (RoboCup Standard Platform League Team).

In 2012, I had M.Sc. in Computer Engineering with the supervision of  [Prof. H. Levent Akın](www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/~akin). My thesis is titled as *Using DEC-POMDP Algorithms to Solve Multi-Agent Decision Problems in Robot Soccer*. I worked on the application of genetic algorithms for learning robot soccer policies.

I have worked on many artificial intelligence and robotics projects, most notably Cerberus and RoboAKUT. Currently, I am studying on my PhD thesis titled *Scalable Multi-Agent Decision Making Algorithms for Real World Problems*. Our aim is to develop multi-agent planning algorithms that scale to solve complex real world problems with many agents and complex states.

My research interests are
* Multi-robot planning in search and rescue tasks
* Multi-agent planning
* High-level robot control
* Machine learning
