I am a PhD candidate in Computer Engineering Department of Boğaziçi University, Istanbul, Turkey. I am a member of Robotics research group led by Prof. H. Levent Akın. My PhD is about Artificial Intelligence and robotics. I have been working to develop general decentralized planning algorithms for complex real world problems. I use RoboCup Rescue Simulation as an application area.
